They are immensely powerful and extensible miracles of universe, which can be tweaked and extended any way imaginable and work with just about any language. But there are two problems with both of them. First of all, they have horrible defaults when comparing to those found in more modern editors such as Sublime and Kate. This gives users the first initiative to start discovering ways to add things that come granted elsewhere such as smart intendation, automatic bracing, line numbers, highlighting and autocomplete. Secondly, since neither Emacs nor vim are based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM CUA</a> standards rest of the world more or less follows, any user seeking to make use of those editors need to learn everything from basics. How to copy, how to paste, how to cut, how to move around, how to save, how to open - and in case of vim - how to even start writing something. Everything must be learned from the scratch. Hell, they even ship with extensive tutorials that take longer to complete than your average Call of Duty single player campaign! Upon finishing those tutorials, you are about as productive as you would be in modern editor within a minute, but still lack all the niceties they ship with as default.</p>\n  <p>Initially when user tries to actually get things done, much of the time is spent searching around on how to do something with the editor. In fact I'd bet most of the time. Instead of writing code or learning to program, user is now spending more time learning the editor. This is the part where their power and extensibility starts turning aganst themselves. User may start a never-ending quest to become as efficient with the editor as possible. Actually programming becomes now a secondary thing. Don't believe me? Just take a look at VimGolf, where users compete with who can accomplish some menial task with as little keystrokes as possible. This kind of thinking about editors starts to impact cognitive workload. Instead of focusing on actual problem to solve, user now focuses on a problem of expressing something with the editor. How do I jump there easily? How do I indent only these lines? What was the trick to do this again? Instead of reading language documentation, user spends time reading editor documentation. Yeah, this has happened to me.</p>\n  <p>Vim as a moded editor also has a habit of really messing with the flow, sometimes really bad. This has happened to me way more often than is necessary: I get into something and code away, then hit the esc to do some line editing, forget to switch back to [<b>i</b>]nsert mode, and accidentally type string of commands because my stupid brain thinks it switches over by itself from command mode. Of course it doesn't! Suddenly whole lines of code are missing, cursor has jumped to some mysterious place and I'm flambergasted as to what the hell just happened.

Rest of the time keyring is encrypted. Again, change happened very late to the lifecycle of KDE4, with experimental pam-auth being implemented in 4.13.</p>\n  <p>Usability problems didn't end there. The system got a reputation of being laggy. This was technically not the case. It was just that for some reason, Plasma designers decided that having a persistent laggy animation almost everywhere was a good thing. For example, opening the Plasma menu and hovering mouse cursor over menu items had the hover-over animation lagging behind mouse movements. This lag-effect also was in the taskbar, in krunner results and in kickoff menu. The user didn't get visual cue instantly. Changing animation speeds didn't help either. It felt boggy and heavy, despite the entire desktop with full services enabled and entire klibs preloaded used just wee bit over 200MB of RAM. Partial improvement didn't happen until the very last release of 4.14, when taskbar became responsive out of blue as a minor enchantment.</p>\n  <p>The design in itself of the KDE 4-series was consistently ugly as sin, both inside and outside. It was common wisdom that after installing KDE, one should reserve one evening to set up everything. I developed such a routine that I did it in less than a hour post-install. For sake of writing it down for the first time and enshrine for future generations: swap Oxygen deco to Plastik, disable bunch of transparency effects, make animations near-instant, change colour scheme to my own Aava, set gradients to zero, set up bunch of shortcuts like quick tiling with meta+arrows, kick off Kickoff launcher and replace it with Homerun, swap Air plasma theme to Oxygen, set mouse cursor to Zion, change how toolbar works by setting it to sort manually, disable \"helpful tips\", change window placement rules to cascading from \"smart\", delete all inevitable dupes from application menu, set window buttons to: window_menu,keep_above,min,max,close, set mousewheel over titlebar to shade window, hack ibus to integrate properly, disable system sounds, disable startups splash screen, tweak tray to be more relevant. That should do it! It would be much easier to make a script for this all like I did for GNOME3, but for some odd reason that was not possible. Or maybe it was. But there was no such thing as gsettings is for GNOME3 as far as I am aware.</p>\n  <p>Granted, there was a massive amount of development that needed to happen in order to even make KDE SC happen. The vision proved too much to accomplish. It ruined the reputation of the once-dominant desktop environment and made a system filled with brilliant innovations and many industry firsts a running gag within Linux community. This was a tragedy of grand scale, taking into account the size of willing developers struggling in the codebase and users trying over and over if the system is usable, because it promised so much good from day one. Thankfully, the new KDE 5-series or \"Plasma 5 / Frameworks 5 by KDE community\" as they insist on calling the entirety, has abandoned the monolithic thinking and embraced a more modular architecture and development model. Now the framework libraries, desktop and applications are separately developed entities. Previously largely singular kdelibs have been made smaller, more manageable pieces. There is no longer any drive to release everything at once. This makes dependency footprint of applications smaller, and pinpointing of bugs easier.</p>\n  <p>As I am now writing this in KDE 5 made of frameworks version 5.9.0 and Plasma 5.3, it is already obvious that the project has made a great decision. Plasma 5-series is just about year old now counting from 5.0 release, with 5.2 being the first release that got good-to-go for daily use thumbs-up from developers. All the past issues with gross instability, glitchiness, usability errors and design seem to have been fixed. In fact, this desktop is the best one I have ever used in my life, and certainly the most beautiful - by default. The way forward can only make this better still, as the few remaining glitches and incompatibilities are ironed out, and this time hopefully for good once they are squashed for the first time. In the end, experiences of the past seven years seem to have paid off and the same mistakes are now actively avoided. The only question is: was doing all those mistakes for so long really necessary?</p>\n  <footer>2016-07-23</footer>\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Kde4'\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kde4.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kde4.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Kde4.vue?vue&type=template&id=164454ec&\"\nimport script from \"./Kde4.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Kde4.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_c('h1',{attrs:{\"name\":\"kiinankieli\"}},[_vm._v(\"Kiinan kielen oppimisesta\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Kiinan kielen opettelu on haastavaa.

When you start digging into these kinds of things, you are bound to discover something very ugly. And I did just that.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Basically, the whole standardization effort of Common Lisp was initialized by US Department of Defense, because it was funding whole lot of research that was going on and there were so many lispers around. Thanks to pre-internet era, researchers were using pretty much local Lisp dialects specific to their area, largely incompatible and unportable, which had been cooking in their labs with myriad of different hardware and operating systems for decades. Thus, DoD decreed that for funding to continue, all the interest groups need to gather and create uniform standard Lisp. Too bad there was already dialect called Standard Lisp, so what became was Common Lisp. The standardization process was long and overtly political, with everyone wanting to maintain some compatibility with their own dialect or have it work like their dialect. In the first round Americans even forgot that they are not the only lispers on planet, forgetting to invite Europeans and Japanese into the standardization process. This was remedied later, but the damage was done and yet another dialect was born, called EuLisp. Arguably the largest damage that got done during this process was not defining Common Lisp as Lisp-1 type, which led to Great Schism only comparable in size to separation of Catholic and Orthodox churches. Common Lisp decided to remain as Lisp-2, and this was mostly strong armed by the Lisp Machine corporations such as Symbolics, because their dialects were Lisp-2 so obviously their business would suffer. Keep in mind that they went out of business very shortly thereafter anyways.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"So, what are Lisp-1 and Lisp-2? It means differences in namespace. Lisp-1 has one namespace for all symbols, shared between functions and variables. That means that you can't have function named list and variable named list in the same scope. Lisp-2 has two namespaces for symbols, one for functions and one for variables. You can now have function list and variable list. Already in 1970's there emerged a dialect called Scheme which had only one namespace. Benefits of one namespace lie in cleaner code and even simpler interaction with the language, which in turn theoretically allows even more powerful expressions than Lisp-2. I myself can't say much on the matter except for the immediately obvious cleanliness part due to some exposure to Scheme but looking at other Lisps it might have some truth in it. Clojure, which is perhaps the highest profile and latest Lisp, is Lisp-1 type. So is EuLisp and obviously all the myriad of Scheme implementations which are borderline dialects (Racket, Chicken, Bigloo...). Obviously, lots of very smart people have deemed Lisp-1 as a superior solution. That leaves Common Lisp pair-dancing with Emacs Lisp as the only Lisp-2 types. Curiously, both have their roots in times before Scheme, which make them look a bit like ancient relics. If Common Lisp had been made as Lisp-1 during the standardization process, I have no doubts that Common Lisp usage would be higher. Now, I must stress that multiple namespaces are not in any way a bad thing. On contrary, C programmers struggle with single namespace. It is entirely possible that single namespace is a dead-end, a groovy 70's fad which Scheme adapted from C. In any case, there was a schism, and Common Lisp is less clean. Enter the next problem.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Common Lisp has implementations, roughly aimed at different things. Thanks to apparent end of standardization process once it was finished in 1994, they implement a lot of things differently. Most recommended implementation is SBCL due to high performance. Different implementations are not that bad of a thing, since all languages have them (think GCC vs CLANG, Oracle JDK vs Open JDK etc.). It's that standards committee is apparently either dead or in cryostasis, and the longer the spec is not updated, the farther implementations start to drift, making updating the standard very long process with lots of compromises (sound familiar?). Scheme and Clojure are a lot more active in that regard, with latest Scheme spec R7RS published 2013 and latest Clojure four days ago (version 1.8, 2016-01-19). That means that for someone wanting to learn Lisp, there is no single Lisp to learn from: which dialect, which implementation? To make things worse, there is that serious technical rift between Common Lisp and the rest due to great Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 schism, which seems to be won by the former judging by the apparent success of Clojure. Hell, even GNU endorses Guile, a Scheme, as the official scripting language. It's like trying to learn how to bicycle in a candy-store while trying to decide candy for the evening. That is, if you are aware of this, which you dear curious reader now are. If you simply plunge into learning some Lisp like I did, then you will be ok, although after learning of all this you may have some serious afterthoughts (I know I had).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"To further increase difficulty of deciding what to learn, Common Lisp is widely held as most practical choice for real-life programming. Greenspun's Tenth Rule states that \\\"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\\\" That means that to do same things Common Lisp has readily built-in or can express effortlessly, C developers must put in a lot of effort and end-result will still be substandard. This also applies to other languages, including Scheme. I've been asking around, and indeed Schemers tend to replicate things that are in Common Lisp in their programs, but this is simply because Common Lisp is much larger. Scheme R7RS specification is 88 pages, while Common Lisp CLtL2 is 1096 pages. Kind of like comparing C to C++, so it is not surprising. A paining what-if scenario is imagining if Common Lisp had become Lisp-1, that is, practically a very large Scheme for very serious and practical uses. Then the comparison between C and C++ would be direct, as Common Lisp and Scheme would be compatible in the most fundamental level. Then there would essentially be only the choice of large or small Lisp to hack with. Then again, we still don't have long enough hindsight to decide if Lisp-1 indeed is truly superior or historical error. There really is no consensus on that.

Keep in mind that they went out of business very shortly thereafter anyways.</p>\n  <p>So, what are Lisp-1 and Lisp-2? It means differences in namespace. Lisp-1 has one namespace for all symbols, shared between functions and variables. That means that you can't have function named list and variable named list in the same scope. Lisp-2 has two namespaces for symbols, one for functions and one for variables. You can now have function list and variable list. Already in 1970's there emerged a dialect called Scheme which had only one namespace. Benefits of one namespace lie in cleaner code and even simpler interaction with the language, which in turn theoretically allows even more powerful expressions than Lisp-2. I myself can't say much on the matter except for the immediately obvious cleanliness part due to some exposure to Scheme but looking at other Lisps it might have some truth in it. Clojure, which is perhaps the highest profile and latest Lisp, is Lisp-1 type. So is EuLisp and obviously all the myriad of Scheme implementations which are borderline dialects (Racket, Chicken, Bigloo...). Obviously, lots of very smart people have deemed Lisp-1 as a superior solution. That leaves Common Lisp pair-dancing with Emacs Lisp as the only Lisp-2 types. Curiously, both have their roots in times before Scheme, which make them look a bit like ancient relics. If Common Lisp had been made as Lisp-1 during the standardization process, I have no doubts that Common Lisp usage would be higher. Now, I must stress that multiple namespaces are not in any way a bad thing. On contrary, C programmers struggle with single namespace. It is entirely possible that single namespace is a dead-end, a groovy 70's fad which Scheme adapted from C. In any case, there was a schism, and Common Lisp is less clean. Enter the next problem.</p>\n  <p>Common Lisp has implementations, roughly aimed at different things. Thanks to apparent end of standardization process once it was finished in 1994, they implement a lot of things differently. Most recommended implementation is SBCL due to high performance. Different implementations are not that bad of a thing, since all languages have them (think GCC vs CLANG, Oracle JDK vs Open JDK etc.). It's that standards committee is apparently either dead or in cryostasis, and the longer the spec is not updated, the farther implementations start to drift, making updating the standard very long process with lots of compromises (sound familiar?). Scheme and Clojure are a lot more active in that regard, with latest Scheme spec R7RS published 2013 and latest Clojure four days ago (version 1.8, 2016-01-19). That means that for someone wanting to learn Lisp, there is no single Lisp to learn from: which dialect, which implementation? To make things worse, there is that serious technical rift between Common Lisp and the rest due to great Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 schism, which seems to be won by the former judging by the apparent success of Clojure. Hell, even GNU endorses Guile, a Scheme, as the official scripting language. It's like trying to learn how to bicycle in a candy-store while trying to decide candy for the evening. That is, if you are aware of this, which you dear curious reader now are. If you simply plunge into learning some Lisp like I did, then you will be ok, although after learning of all this you may have some serious afterthoughts (I know I had).</p>\n  <p>To further increase difficulty of deciding what to learn, Common Lisp is widely held as most practical choice for real-life programming. Greenspun's Tenth Rule states that \"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\" That means that to do same things Common Lisp has readily built-in or can express effortlessly, C developers must put in a lot of effort and end-result will still be substandard. This also applies to other languages, including Scheme. I've been asking around, and indeed Schemers tend to replicate things that are in Common Lisp in their programs, but this is simply because Common Lisp is much larger. Scheme R7RS specification is 88 pages, while Common Lisp CLtL2 is 1096 pages. Kind of like comparing C to C++, so it is not surprising. A paining what-if scenario is imagining if Common Lisp had become Lisp-1, that is, practically a very large Scheme for very serious and practical uses. Then the comparison between C and C++ would be direct, as Common Lisp and Scheme would be compatible in the most fundamental level. Then there would essentially be only the choice of large or small Lisp to hack with. Then again, we still don't have long enough hindsight to decide if Lisp-1 indeed is truly superior or historical error. There really is no consensus on that. But there is the rift.</p>\n  <p>On the bright side, understanding basic operating principle of either plus the main difference makes switching between Scheme and Common Lisp very trivial. A few examples:</p>\n\n  <code>\n  ;;common lisp<br>\n  (defun pow (x) <br>\n    (* x x))<br><br>\n\n  ;;scheme<br>\n  (define (pow x) <br>\n    (* x x))<br><br>\n\n  ;;common lisp<br>\n  (defvar x 5)<br><br>\n\n  ;;scheme<br>\n  (define x 5)\n  </code>\n\n  <p>The largest difference in syntax is in handling of functions that are not in beginning of list due to different approaches to namespace. In Common Lisp, you need to explicitly state with #' that what you are calling is a function in places where program excepts variable. These are the same, first two are Common Lisp, first line without syntactic sugar and then all sugar, same with last two Scheme examples:</p>\n\n  <code>\n    (map (quote list) (function +) (list 1 2) (list 3 5))<br>\n    (mapcar #'+ '(1 2) '(3 5))<br><br>\n\n    (map + (list 1 2) (list 3 5))<br>\n    (map + '(1 2) '(3 5))\n  </code>\n\n  <p>These differences give Scheme a certain pleasant airy feel to it compared to Common Lisp. It also makes building higher-order functions easier and makes the look of program more consistent. Then again, the airy feel comes with price: you can't give variables simple names like list is the classic example, and generally the space for functions and variables diminishes rapidly the larger the application gets. Other caveat is readability. While less pleasant looking thanks to that ugly #', you can spot functions immediately at a glance. There are always two sides to the coin.</p>\n  <p>It should be noted, that while Scheme was devised by two life-long academics as research and teaching language, Common Lisp evolved over decades of use by scientists, industry and military. Notably parallel with Scheme before and after standardization process. It is one seriously battle-hardened language. There may be more to the story of why it is Lisp-2 than just \"stubborn greedy companies\" which was my initial thought. Jury is still out on the matter, and it might be never resolved. Scheme has hygienic macros, Lisp has true macros. Scheme is restricted in namespace, Lisp is not (and can create new ones trivially). Scheme has symbol case sensitivity, Lisp doesn't. Even now, there are also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X69_42Mj-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">very smart people</a> who make a conscious and well-informed decision to make new implementations of Common Lisp instead of Scheme for their needs. Finally, Common Lisp is simply great fun. It's dead simple, powerful and just reading about its history is exciting. In a sense, it is the eternal programming language.</p>\n  <p>In case you read this entire thing, I might as well give reading recommendations. As a result, from being battle-hardened programming language with deep roots and with exceptional capabilities even today, it has excellent literature available.</p>\n\n  <ul><b>Books</b>\n    <li>Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation (1990)</li>\n    <li>Let Over Lambda (2008)</li>\n    <li>Practical Common Lisp (2005)</li>\n    <li>On Lisp (1993)</li>\n    <li>ANSI Common Lisp (1996)</li>\n    <li>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp (1992)</li>\n    <li>Land of Lisp (2011)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <br/>\n  <ul><b>Articles</b>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beating the Averages</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070407230302/http://bc.tech.coop/blog/060118.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lisp is for Entrepreneurs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.loper-os.org/?p=69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Where Lisp Fails: at Turning People into Fungible Cogs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Ruby is an acceptable Lisp</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://locklessinc.com/articles/why_lisp_failed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Lisp Failed</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/writings/Lisp_Curse.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lisp Curse</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <footer>2016-01-23</footer>\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Lisp1'\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=template&id=093565b0&\"\nimport script from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"Thoughts on Lisp, part 2\")]),_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":require(\"../../assets/you-have-lisp.jpg\"),\"alt\":\"[You have Lisp funny]\",\"title\":\"from 'Git The Princess!' comic by Mart Virkus, Toggl\"}}),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Initially my adventures in Lisp began because of conscious search for the ultimate programming language.

After dabbling for a while with iwconfig, I deemed the attempt hopeless and too time consuming. Network manager really exists for a reason, it does. Trying to connect to WPA2 secured network with iwconfig is just too much effort. Luckily, my X220 has a proper LAN port, so I fetched a LAN cable and decided to purge LxQt and fix my KDE. Nope! For some reason, the computer now couldn't upkeep the connection. It closed after a few seconds, resulting in yet another failure. Something like that hasn't happened to me on wired connection on Linux ever. <i>EVER!</i> sudo ifconfig eth0 up and... nothing. Nothing apparently happened. Absolutely nothing. Something was horribly wrong now for no good reason (except somehow missing nm obviously, but overriding it with ifconfig has worked <i>before</i>). sudo dhclient, then. Now we are talking, I got things going on wireless side.</p>\n  <p>Then in my folly and deadly curiosity, I decided to install and test the upcoming Unity 8 while at it. This move apparently broke almost the entire KDE. In addition, switching to lightdm didn't play out so well. I was still in good ol' sddm, and could only login to my broken Plasma desktop. Luckily krunner was working while everything in panel was broken and desktop was black and void. I finally got all set. Or so I thought. Now as I rebooted, the xfce(??) lightdm flashed by, while it just moments ago didn't show up despite telling systemctl to exclusively use it.</p>\n  <p>And thus all screens went blank. Tried to unplug other monitor. That was not the problem, still blank. Tried to use one of tty's. No dice. System didn't let me to enter tty! Screen still blank. Reboot, nothing. At this point, I had no other option than to reinstall the entire system. Ahh, luckily it happens fast, and my /home is obviously separate partition. Wipe everything, continue with old configs, takes ten minutes on SSD. Now that things worked and I had promptly decided to return to a more robust distro anyways for good, I decided to play around a little more. So I installed Ubuntu proper on top of Kubuntu, sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop. Now mouse cursor is switching between Breeze and DMZ depending on underlying application like mazed epileptic rat in meth. Meanwhile in Unity, ibus stubbornly refused to co-operate with me, showing sunpinyin as a choice but nothing really happened when selecting it. I need my pinyin input, please. Installing XFCE 4.12 gave more laughs, as for some reason it decided to include its own tray area and also Unity's tray.

Breeze changed automatically how the icons looked like depending on their size. And not just a little bit, but a lot. Complete break of consistency. To me, that's a big nope when it comes to visual design. Keeping things consistent = less user confusion. Simple as that. I also was never a fan of the extremely minimalistic wireframe icons, while Breeze proper icons are great. Thus, imagine my personal frustration when I had to look at those. I actually reverted back to KDE4's Oxygen icons on KDE5 because of that.</p>\n    <p>Now, in KDE Visual Design Group's defense, root cause to why icons meant for small interfaces such as toolbars and menu icons (still a bad idea in my opinion!) ended up popping up in file browser and taskbars was in how KDE itself handled icons. There was some serious difficulty in getting KDE to understand if-this-then-this when it comes to deciding which type of small icon to use. From programmatic viewpoint I fully understand that it can't just deduce automagically what it should default to. Quite a nightmare if something like that hadn't been done before. That said, the approach is clearly wrong anyways. Keeping icons consistent no matter what size they are is the only correct approach.</p>\n    <footer>2020-11-27</footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Kde'\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kde.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kde.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Kde.vue?vue&type=template&id=cc60bd1a&\"\nimport script from \"./Kde.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Kde.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_vm._m(0),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The full list of distros I've used in somewhat chronological order is the following:\")]),_c('p',{attrs:{\"id\":\"distrostring\"}},[_vm._v(\"Best Linux 2000, Red Hat Linux, Mandrake, ELKS, Puppy, Ubuntu, Debian, Yellow Dog Linux, Fedora Core, openSUSE, Korora, Arch, Gentoo, CentOS, Raspbian\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Each with a story of its own.

User can now list files in given path to make sure they are operating on correct folder, as well as preview renaming results.</p>\n\n  <img class=\"demo\" src=\"../../assets/renamerfx-v1.3.0.png\">\n  <p class=\"descriptor\">Version 1.3.0. Less colour, more features.</p>\n  <p>With new features and milder color scheme, this project is shaping up into a capable little tool. Not sure how I feel about this \"more professional\" color scheme. Experimental harsh colors with strong contrasts have their charm. They mark the product and make it recognizable. I'm strongly inclined to move back to more colorful presentation.</p>\n\n  <p>Take a look at its sources <a href=\"https://github.com/otjura/RenamerFX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on its GitHub page.</a></p>\n\n  <footer>2021-01-11</footer>\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'RenamerFX',\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./RenamerFX.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
