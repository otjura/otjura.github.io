There was only a small problem: it didn't work. Plasma and everything shipping with it on day one were borderline unusable. It took the project four point releases to make the system somewhat usable. As years went by, KDE still struggled. KDE became pretty much synonymous with glitch and crash. Not a single enterprise distribution ended up using KDE in these years. While being largest global collaborative open-source project after the Linux kernel itself, KDE remained in the fringes. Users were flocking to GNOME, XFCE, LXDE and later on to Mint. Few distro spins such as Kubuntu and Chakra aside, no major distro adapted KDE as the primary desktop. openSUSE was widely regarded as the only exception due its heavy focus on polishing KDE, but in the end even SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop which is derived from openSUSE went with way more stable GNOME every time.

That means, stable enough to do things without constant fear of something crashing or getting stuck out of nowhere. That is six years of development on massive scale. Revealing of the massive scale of everything was the dependencies which came with KDE applications. If a GNOME user decided to install a KDE application, such as Kate, a great text-editor, in a system "untainted" by KDE, he better prepare to pull 200MB of dependencies with it. This led to strict separation followed by many users. Even if KDE application was way better than GTK alternative, it was wise to take the alternative.

There was for example a bug in PDF content indexing, where Strigi aimlessly tried to index content it couldn't understand. A fast hack piping PDF to text format to be indexed was deviced, but unsurprisingly it didn't work too well either. Slowly KDE became a system hacked together, only adding to code burden. What was supposed to be an elegant architecture became a shoddy patchwork very rapidly out of nescessity. This in turn made the code practically unmaintainable. It is telling, that entering generic search term such as \"desktop\" into the bugtracker would tell, that Bugzilla can't display so many results.

Once I started getting into Common Lisp, I started getting into Lisp in general. And here there be dragons.

They are missing from the ANSI standard, which is now 21 years old and never revised since. Implementation of lot of things not specified in standard vary by implementation. Things in SBCL are totally different to CLISP when it comes to sockets, so I had to do some reading of SBCL manual in addition to book I was reading on Common Lisp which uses CLISP (Conrad Barski's excellent Land of Lisp). Well, standard doesn't need to define everything, sure, but that led to late-night reading as to why the standard is so damn old. Surely minor advances like the whole Internet thingy would warrant some updates to spec, even if the language is most likely most powerful in existence. When you start digging into these kinds of things, you are bound to discover something very ugly. And I did just that.")]),i("p",[e._v("Basically, the whole standardization effort of Common Lisp was initialized by US Department of Defense, because it was funding whole lot of research that was going on and there were so many lispers around. Thanks to pre-internet era, researchers were using pretty much local Lisp dialects specific to their area, largely incompatible and unportable, which had been cooking in their labs with myriad of different hardware and operating systems for decades. Thus, DoD decreed that for funding to continue, all the interest groups need to gather and create uniform standard Lisp. Too bad there was already dialect called Standard Lisp, so what became was Common Lisp. The standardization process was long and overtly political, with everyone wanting to maintain some compatibility with their own dialect or have it work like their dialect. In the first round Americans even forgot that they are not the only lispers on planet, forgetting to invite Europeans and Japanese into the standardization process. This was remedied later, but the damage was done and yet another dialect was born, called EuLisp. Arguably the largest damage that got done during this process was not defining Common Lisp as Lisp-1 type, which led to Great Schism only comparable in size to separation of Catholic and Orthodox churches. Common Lisp decided to remain as Lisp-2, and this was mostly strong armed by the Lisp Machine corporations such as Symbolics, because their dialects were Lisp-2 so obviously their business would suffer. Keep in mind that they went out of business very shortly thereafter anyways.")]),i("p",[e._v("So, what are Lisp-1 and Lisp-2? It means differences in namespace. Lisp-1 has one namespace for all symbols, shared between functions and variables. That means that you can't have function named list and variable named list in the same scope. Lisp-2 has two namespaces for symbols, one for functions and one for variables. You can now have function list and variable list. Already in 1970's there emerged a dialect called Scheme which had only one namespace. Benefits of one namespace lie in cleaner code and even simpler interaction with the language, which in turn theoretically allows even more powerful expressions than Lisp-2. I myself can't say much on the matter except for the immediately obvious cleanliness part due to some exposure to Scheme but looking at other Lisps it might have some truth in it. Clojure, which is perhaps the highest profile and latest Lisp, is Lisp-1 type. So is EuLisp and obviously all the myriad of Scheme implementations which are borderline dialects (Racket, Chicken, Bigloo...). Obviously, lots of very smart people have deemed Lisp-1 as a superior solution. That leaves Common Lisp pair-dancing with Emacs Lisp as the only Lisp-2 types. Curiously, both have their roots in times before Scheme, which make them look a bit like ancient relics. If Common Lisp had been made as Lisp-1 during the standardization process, I have no doubts that Common Lisp usage would be higher. Now, I must stress that multiple namespaces are not in any way a bad thing. On contrary, C programmers struggle with single namespace. It is entirely possible that single namespace is a dead-end, a groovy 70's fad which Scheme adapted from C. In any case, there was a schism, and Common Lisp is less clean. Enter the next problem.")]),i("p",[e._v("Common Lisp has implementations, roughly aimed at different things. Thanks to apparent end of standardization process once it was finished in 1994, they implement a lot of things differently. Most recommended implementation is SBCL due to high performance. Different implementations are not that bad of a thing, since all languages have them (think GCC vs CLANG, Oracle JDK vs Open JDK etc.). It's that standards committee is apparently either dead or in cryostasis, and the longer the spec is not updated, the farther implementations start to drift, making updating the standard very long process with lots of compromises (sound familiar?). Scheme and Clojure are a lot more active in that regard, with latest Scheme spec R7RS published 2013 and latest Clojure four days ago (version 1.8, 2016-01-19). That means that for someone wanting to learn Lisp, there is no single Lisp to learn from: which dialect, which implementation? To make things worse, there is that serious technical rift between Common Lisp and the rest due to great Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 schism, which seems to be won by the former judging by the apparent success of Clojure. Hell, even GNU endorses Guile, a Scheme, as the official scripting language. It's like trying to learn how to bicycle in a candy-store while trying to decide candy for the evening.

This also applies to other languages, including Scheme. I've been asking around, and indeed Schemers tend to replicate things that are in Common Lisp in their programs, but this is simply because Common Lisp is much larger. Scheme R7RS specification is 88 pages, while Common Lisp CLtL2 is 1096 pages. Kind of like comparing C to C++, so it is not surprising. A paining what-if scenario is imagining if Common Lisp had become Lisp-1, that is, practically a very large Scheme for very serious and practical uses. Then the comparison between C and C++ would be direct, as Common Lisp and Scheme would be compatible in the most fundamental level. Then there would essentially be only the choice of large or small Lisp to hack with.
