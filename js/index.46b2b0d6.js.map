My bachelor <b>thesis</b> subject was <i>Koneellinen syväoppiminen: metodit ja arkkitehtuurit</i> (Deep Learning: Methods and Architectures). It focused on technical similarities and differences between the different deep learning methods, and how they are usually categorized and by which key attributes. To my professor's knowledge, this was <b>the first</b> work of its kind in Finnish language. I had to make up a lot of new Finnish vocabulary for the <b>cutting edge AI</b> my thesis was about during its writing process.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      My true specialization is in <b>software engineering</b>. Easily maintainable code with clear architecture is what I strive for. <b>SOLID and DRY</b>. If it executes fast and is safe, all the better. I have toyed with multiple programmming languages from C++ to Haskell to Clojure, which gives me a wide perspective on software development. My main programming language is <b>Java</b>, with shell scripting, JavaScript and Python as comfortable auxiliaries.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I'm occupationally fluent in Finnish and English, have proficiency in Swedish and Norwegian, a conversational grasp of German, and know basic Chinese.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I'm currently employed at <a href=\"https://assetti.pro/product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Assetti</a>, developing a high-availability web-based asset management software used for milions in property valuation.

KDE's new Plasma was a very ambitious project. It was supposed to combine cutting-edge semantic desktop system where everything is connected into a modern, uniform, network transparent and customizable desktop environment. There was only a small problem: it didn't work. Plasma and everything shipping with it on day one were borderline unusable. It took the project four point releases to make the system somewhat usable. As years went by, KDE still struggled. KDE became pretty much synonymous with glitch and crash. Not a single enterprise distribution ended up using KDE in these years. While being largest global collaborative open-source project after the Linux kernel itself, KDE remained in the fringes. Users were flocking to GNOME, XFCE, LXDE and later on to Mint. Few distro spins such as Kubuntu and Chakra aside, no major distro adapted KDE as the primary desktop. openSUSE was widely regarded as the only exception due its heavy focus on polishing KDE, but in the end even SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop which is derived from openSUSE went with way more stable GNOME every time. Why did this happen? Could it have been avoided?\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In order to reach uniformity and interconnectedness of the entire system, KDE adopted a massively monolithic development model. KDE became a SC, a software compilation, where the KDE Plasma desktop was just part of the whole. Everything from underlying libraries to applications like Dolphin was to be updated all at once to ensure that interoperability remained good. That sounds reasonable in theory, but in practice everything went to hell. It wasn't until final years, in my opinion until the final release of KDE 4.14, the last of KDE4-series releases, that things actually got stable enough to consider good enough for daily use. That means, stable enough to do things without constant fear of something crashing or getting stuck out of nowhere. That is six years of development on massive scale. Revealing of the massive scale of everything was the dependencies which came with KDE applications. If a GNOME user decided to install a KDE application, such as Kate, a great text-editor, in a system \\\"untainted\\\" by KDE, he better prepare to pull 200MB of dependencies with it. This led to strict separation followed by many users. Even if KDE application was way better than GTK alternative, it was wise to take the alternative. I remember showing my father how to install things from Ubuntu Software Centre, and he clicked Gwenview the image viewer before I had chance to explain. There we waited, as otherwise small image viewer downloaded for minutes on the poor internet connection. \\\"Why is this taking so long?\\\" \\\"Ummm... dad it's practically installing another desktop system now as well lol :D\\\".\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"As if that wasn't enough, part of the intended core functionality was essentially lost, because it worked so badly that many users opted to switch it off entirely. I'm talking about the duo of Strigi, the file indexer, and Akonadi, the PIM management system. Strigi was so demanding on resources and initially was not limited in any way on the resource usage, that it could bring even a desktop system capable of running Crysis on knees. There was for example a bug in PDF content indexing, where Strigi aimlessly tried to index content it couldn't understand. A fast hack piping PDF to text format to be indexed was deviced, but unsurprisingly it didn't work too well either. Slowly KDE became a system hacked together, only adding to code burden. What was supposed to be an elegant architecture became a shoddy patchwork very rapidly out of nescessity. This in turn made the code practically unmaintainable. It is telling, that entering generic search term such as \\\"desktop\\\" into the bugtracker would tell, that Bugzilla can't display so many results. When all else started failing, the KDE developers made a rather drastic decision around 4.13 release to swap Strigi with more lightweight Baloo file indexer. The semantic desktop that developers had envisioned never saw daylight in working condition.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The other issues past the system critical dysfunctionality were in the usability and user interaction. Sometimes they went on a deep level, such as unwillingness of developers to implelent a proper pam-auth and instead sticking to KWallet system, which in theory was more secure, but got so much in the way of daily use, that disabling it by leaving it without password - that is, storing all passwords and secrets unencrypted - became a common recommendation for those many who found it nuisance. For those who never used KDE, imagine opening your mail application. That would require you to give your user password. Or connecting to previously known WLAN, that would require giving user password as well. Or storing a new one, because that would again require opening the wallet. Keyring system that has been in use in every other system from OS X to GNOME to even LXDE was not there. Keyrings are opened transparently, assuming user has managed to log in the system. Rest of the time keyring is encrypted. Again, change happened very late to the lifecycle of KDE4, with experimental pam-auth being implemented in 4.13.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Usability problems didn't end there. The system got a reputation of being laggy. This was technically not the case. It was just that for some reason, Plasma designers decided that having a persistent laggy animation almost everywhere was a good thing. For example, opening the Plasma menu and hovering mouse cursor over menu items had the hover-over animation lagging behind mouse movements. This lag-effect also was in the taskbar, in krunner results and in kickoff menu. The user didn't get visual cue instantly. Changing animation speeds didn't help either. It felt boggy and heavy, despite the entire desktop with full services enabled and entire klibs preloaded used just wee bit over 200MB of RAM. Partial improvement didn't happen until the very last release of 4.14, when taskbar became responsive out of blue as a minor enchantment.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The design in itself of the KDE 4-series was consistently ugly as sin, both inside and outside. It was common wisdom that after installing KDE, one should reserve one evening to set up everything. I developed such a routine that I did it in less than a hour post-install. For sake of writing it down for the first time and enshrine for future generations: swap Oxygen deco to Plastik, disable bunch of transparency effects, make animations near-instant, change colour scheme to my own Aava, set gradients to zero, set up bunch of shortcuts like quick tiling with meta+arrows, kick off Kickoff launcher and replace it with Homerun, swap Air plasma theme to Oxygen, set mouse cursor to Zion, change how toolbar works by setting it to sort manually, disable \\\"helpful tips\\\", change window placement rules to cascading from \\\"smart\\\", delete all inevitable dupes from application menu, set window buttons to: window_menu,keep_above,min,max,close, set mousewheel over titlebar to shade window, hack ibus to integrate properly, disable system sounds, disable startups splash screen, tweak tray to be more relevant. That should do it! It would be much easier to make a script for this all like I did for GNOME3, but for some odd reason that was not possible. Or maybe it was. But there was no such thing as gsettings is for GNOME3 as far as I am aware.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Granted, there was a massive amount of development that needed to happen in order to even make KDE SC happen. The vision proved too much to accomplish. It ruined the reputation of the once-dominant desktop environment and made a system filled with brilliant innovations and many industry firsts a running gag within Linux community. This was a tragedy of grand scale, taking into account the size of willing developers struggling in the codebase and users trying over and over if the system is usable, because it promised so much good from day one. Thankfully, the new KDE 5-series or \\\"Plasma 5 / Frameworks 5 by KDE community\\\" as they insist on calling the entirety, has abandoned the monolithic thinking and embraced a more modular architecture and development model. Now the framework libraries, desktop and applications are separately developed entities. Previously largely singular kdelibs have been made smaller, more manageable pieces. There is no longer any drive to release everything at once. This makes dependency footprint of applications smaller, and pinpointing of bugs easier.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"As I am now writing this in KDE 5 made of frameworks version 5.9.0 and Plasma 5.3, it is already obvious that the project has made a great decision.

KDE's new Plasma was a very ambitious project. It was supposed to combine cutting-edge semantic desktop system where everything is connected into a modern, uniform, network transparent and customizable desktop environment. There was only a small problem: it didn't work. Plasma and everything shipping with it on day one were borderline unusable. It took the project four point releases to make the system somewhat usable. As years went by, KDE still struggled. KDE became pretty much synonymous with glitch and crash. Not a single enterprise distribution ended up using KDE in these years. While being largest global collaborative open-source project after the Linux kernel itself, KDE remained in the fringes. Users were flocking to GNOME, XFCE, LXDE and later on to Mint. Few distro spins such as Kubuntu and Chakra aside, no major distro adapted KDE as the primary desktop. openSUSE was widely regarded as the only exception due its heavy focus on polishing KDE, but in the end even SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop which is derived from openSUSE went with way more stable GNOME every time. Why did this happen? Could it have been avoided?</p>\n  <p>In order to reach uniformity and interconnectedness of the entire system, KDE adopted a massively monolithic development model. KDE became a SC, a software compilation, where the KDE Plasma desktop was just part of the whole. Everything from underlying libraries to applications like Dolphin was to be updated all at once to ensure that interoperability remained good. That sounds reasonable in theory, but in practice everything went to hell. It wasn't until final years, in my opinion until the final release of KDE 4.14, the last of KDE4-series releases, that things actually got stable enough to consider good enough for daily use. That means, stable enough to do things without constant fear of something crashing or getting stuck out of nowhere. That is six years of development on massive scale. Revealing of the massive scale of everything was the dependencies which came with KDE applications. If a GNOME user decided to install a KDE application, such as Kate, a great text-editor, in a system \"untainted\" by KDE, he better prepare to pull 200MB of dependencies with it. This led to strict separation followed by many users. Even if KDE application was way better than GTK alternative, it was wise to take the alternative. I remember showing my father how to install things from Ubuntu Software Centre, and he clicked Gwenview the image viewer before I had chance to explain. There we waited, as otherwise small image viewer downloaded for minutes on the poor internet connection. \"Why is this taking so long?\" \"Ummm... dad it's practically installing another desktop system now as well lol :D\".</p>\n  <p>As if that wasn't enough, part of the intended core functionality was essentially lost, because it worked so badly that many users opted to switch it off entirely. I'm talking about the duo of Strigi, the file indexer, and Akonadi, the PIM management system. Strigi was so demanding on resources and initially was not limited in any way on the resource usage, that it could bring even a desktop system capable of running Crysis on knees. There was for example a bug in PDF content indexing, where Strigi aimlessly tried to index content it couldn't understand. A fast hack piping PDF to text format to be indexed was deviced, but unsurprisingly it didn't work too well either. Slowly KDE became a system hacked together, only adding to code burden. What was supposed to be an elegant architecture became a shoddy patchwork very rapidly out of nescessity. This in turn made the code practically unmaintainable. It is telling, that entering generic search term such as \"desktop\" into the bugtracker would tell, that Bugzilla can't display so many results. When all else started failing, the KDE developers made a rather drastic decision around 4.13 release to swap Strigi with more lightweight Baloo file indexer. The semantic desktop that developers had envisioned never saw daylight in working condition.</p>\n  <p>The other issues past the system critical dysfunctionality were in the usability and user interaction. Sometimes they went on a deep level, such as unwillingness of developers to implelent a proper pam-auth and instead sticking to KWallet system, which in theory was more secure, but got so much in the way of daily use, that disabling it by leaving it without password - that is, storing all passwords and secrets unencrypted - became a common recommendation for those many who found it nuisance. For those who never used KDE, imagine opening your mail application. That would require you to give your user password. Or connecting to previously known WLAN, that would require giving user password as well. Or storing a new one, because that would again require opening the wallet. Keyring system that has been in use in every other system from OS X to GNOME to even LXDE was not there. Keyrings are opened transparently, assuming user has managed to log in the system. Rest of the time keyring is encrypted. Again, change happened very late to the lifecycle of KDE4, with experimental pam-auth being implemented in 4.13.</p>\n  <p>Usability problems didn't end there. The system got a reputation of being laggy. This was technically not the case. It was just that for some reason, Plasma designers decided that having a persistent laggy animation almost everywhere was a good thing. For example, opening the Plasma menu and hovering mouse cursor over menu items had the hover-over animation lagging behind mouse movements. This lag-effect also was in the taskbar, in krunner results and in kickoff menu. The user didn't get visual cue instantly. Changing animation speeds didn't help either. It felt boggy and heavy, despite the entire desktop with full services enabled and entire klibs preloaded used just wee bit over 200MB of RAM. Partial improvement didn't happen until the very last release of 4.14, when taskbar became responsive out of blue as a minor enchantment.</p>\n  <p>The design in itself of the KDE 4-series was consistently ugly as sin, both inside and outside. It was common wisdom that after installing KDE, one should reserve one evening to set up everything. I developed such a routine that I did it in less than a hour post-install. For sake of writing it down for the first time and enshrine for future generations: swap Oxygen deco to Plastik, disable bunch of transparency effects, make animations near-instant, change colour scheme to my own Aava, set gradients to zero, set up bunch of shortcuts like quick tiling with meta+arrows, kick off Kickoff launcher and replace it with Homerun, swap Air plasma theme to Oxygen, set mouse cursor to Zion, change how toolbar works by setting it to sort manually, disable \"helpful tips\", change window placement rules to cascading from \"smart\", delete all inevitable dupes from application menu, set window buttons to: window_menu,keep_above,min,max,close, set mousewheel over titlebar to shade window, hack ibus to integrate properly, disable system sounds, disable startups splash screen, tweak tray to be more relevant. That should do it! It would be much easier to make a script for this all like I did for GNOME3, but for some odd reason that was not possible. Or maybe it was. But there was no such thing as gsettings is for GNOME3 as far as I am aware.</p>\n  <p>Granted, there was a massive amount of development that needed to happen in order to even make KDE SC happen. The vision proved too much to accomplish. It ruined the reputation of the once-dominant desktop environment and made a system filled with brilliant innovations and many industry firsts a running gag within Linux community. This was a tragedy of grand scale, taking into account the size of willing developers struggling in the codebase and users trying over and over if the system is usable, because it promised so much good from day one. Thankfully, the new KDE 5-series or \"Plasma 5 / Frameworks 5 by KDE community\" as they insist on calling the entirety, has abandoned the monolithic thinking and embraced a more modular architecture and development model. Now the framework libraries, desktop and applications are separately developed entities. Previously largely singular kdelibs have been made smaller, more manageable pieces. There is no longer any drive to release everything at once. This makes dependency footprint of applications smaller, and pinpointing of bugs easier.</p>\n  <p>As I am now writing this in KDE 5 made of frameworks version 5.9.0 and Plasma 5.3, it is already obvious that the project has made a great decision. Plasma 5-series is just about year old now counting from 5.0 release, with 5.2 being the first release that got good-to-go for daily use thumbs-up from developers. All the past issues with gross instability, glitchiness, usability errors and design seem to have been fixed.

Kaiken tuon saa unohtaa kiinan kohdalla, koska Kiina muodostaa itse oman kulttuuripiirisä, sinosfäärin, johon kuuluu Kiinan lisäksi Korea, Japani ja Indokiina. Koko sanasto on täysin erilainen eurooppalaisiin kieliin verrattuna. Siinä ei yksinkertaisesti ole minkäänlaista kiinnikettä mihinkään tuttuun suomalaisesta näkökulmasta katsottuna. Tämä johtaa siihen, että jokainen sana pitää opetella ilman muiden opittujen kielien tarjoamaa tukea. Ajattele vaikkapa germaanisten kielien jakamaa sanastoa. Jos osaa hyvin norjaa, ruotsin ja tanskan opettelu on triviaalia. Jos osaa hyvin saksaa ja englantia, hollantia pystyy lukemaan varsin intuitiivisesti opettelematta kieltä sekuntiakaan. Tähän samankaltaisten kielten tarjoamaan tukeen perustuu ymmärtääkseni polyglottien kyky \"oppia\" uusia kieli muutamassa päivässä. Parhaana esimerkkinä tästä valtavasta erosta alkuaineet, joiden nimet yleisesti ovat kielestä toiseen ovat hyvin samankaltaisia. Jalokaasu radon on radon kaikissa Euroopan kielissä. Kiinaksi? 氩, yà. Ei näytä eikä kuulosta lainkaan samalta. Sama täydellinen outous vallitsee kaikkialla sanastossa. Jokainen ylpeä polyglotti tulee hakkaamaan päätään kiinan kielimuuriin vuosikausia.</p>\r\n  <p>Täysin ufon perussanaston lisäksi kokonaan oma lukunsa on kiinalaisten tapa ilmaista tiettyjä asioita klassisen kiinan idiomeilla, jotka eivät ole mitään mihin kreikkalais-roomalais-kristillisessä kulttuuriperimässä kasvanut eurooppalainen on tottunut. Tuntematta kiinalaisen kirjallisuuden klassikoita, buddhalaisuutta, taolaisuutta ja kiinan myyttistä muinaishistoriaa, ne eivät yksinkertaisesti aukea. Kuten eurooppalaiset, kiinalaiset viljelevät tällaisia sanaparsia antaumuksella. Lisäksi ne usein ilmaistaan klassisella kiinalla, joka tekee niiden hahmottamisesta vieläkin vaikeampaa. Ne ovat kehittyneet määrätyiksi ilmaisuiksi eli inside-läppä meemihokemiksi jotka vain pitää tietää. Tämä lisää ulkoa opettelua entisestään aiemman jo valmiiksi hirvittävän ulkoa opettelun määrän lisäksi. Ja näitä sanaparsia on niin paljon, että niistä on olemassa kokonaisia paksuja sanakirjoja! Niiden käyttö on lisäksi eräänlainen nokkeluuden osoitus. Tämä tarkoittaa, että kiinalaisen nettikeskustelun lukeminen on melkeinpä toivotonta. Ja sama pätee myös keskusteluun kiinalaisten kanssa. Jossain vaiheessa vastaan yksinkertaisesti tulee tavurykelmä, jossa ei ole mitään järkeä. Ja sitten taas. Ja taas. Klassisen kiinan idiomeista on myös johdettu käytäntö lyhentää sanoja mahdollisimman paljon. Suosikkiesimerkkini on 海内外, meri-sisä-ulko, suoraan New Practical Chinese Readerin esipuheesta. Mitä helvettiä se tarkoittaa? Jokin on meren syvyyksissä ja pinnalla vai täh? Ei, ei tietenkään! \"Kotimaassa ja ulkomailla\", sitä se tarkoittaa. Minulla ei ole mitään käsitystä miksi siinä on meren merkki. Lyhentämättömänä saman voisi ilmaista seuraavasti: 祖国和外国. Kahden merkin tähden. Kun varsinaisia klassisia idiomeja on runsaasti, näitä tällaisia on vielä enemmän.</p>\r\n  <p>Nämä kolme seikkaa tekevät kiinan opiskelusta niin työlästä, että suomalaisen pitää suhtautua siihen nöyrästi elämän mittaisena projektina, sillä sujuva kielenkäyttö vaatii kokonaisen uuden kulttuurin omaksumisen, kulttuurin joka on hyvin erilainen kuin omamme. Alkujaan kun aloitin kiinan opiskelun, sain kuvaamieni ensivaikutelmien kautta sellaisen käsityksen, että kiinan oppiminen arjessa pärjäämisen tasolle enintään vuoden. Tämä oli hirvittävä virhelaskelma. Myöhemmin tunnustin hammasta purren, että asia ei ollutkaan niin yksinkertainen ja arvoin uudestaan sujuvuuden saavuttamisen vievän kolme vuotta. Kun en kolmen vuoden opiskelun jälkeenkään kyennyt noin vain lukemaan edes hyvin yksinkertaisesti kirjoitettua kiinalaisille alakoululaisille suunnattua Hans Christian Andersenin satukirjaa, 《安徒生通话》, olin kuitenkin niin edistynyt että hahmotin jo todellisten kielenoppimisen vaikeuksien olevan sellaisia joihin en ollut asennoitunut lainkaan enkä ottanut huomioon (kielioppi, sanasto, idiomit). Tuonkin havainnon tekeminen olisi ollut liki mahdotonta ilman siihen mennessä karttunutta mittavaa kokemusta, sillä suuri enemmistö keskustelusta ja artikkeleista sekä oppimateriaaleista keskittyy nimenomaan merkkeihin ja ääntämiseen. Suurimmat kompastuskivet ovat näkymättömissä rannan mutapohjassa eikä niihin kompastu ja lyö päätään ennen kuin on jo kahlannut tarpeeksi syvälle.</p>\r\n  <footer>2016-07-23</footer>\r\n</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'Kiinankieli'\r\n}\r\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kiinankieli.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Kiinankieli.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Kiinankieli.vue?vue&type=template&id=76000f38&\"\nimport script from \"./Kiinankieli.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Kiinankieli.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"Thoughts on Lisp\")]),_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":require(\"../../assets/Lisp-Machine-Hackers.jpg\")}}),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"I spent much of summer 2015 studying Common Lisp.

Once I started getting into Common Lisp, I started getting into Lisp in general. And here there be dragons. First thing when I ventured into networking side of things was that despite Common Lisp being quite large with 927 symbols, none deal with sockets. They are missing from the ANSI standard, which is now 21 years old and never revised since. Implementation of lot of things not specified in standard vary by implementation. Things in SBCL are totally different to CLISP when it comes to sockets, so I had to do some reading of SBCL manual in addition to book I was reading on Common Lisp which uses CLISP (Conrad Barski's excellent Land of Lisp). Well, standard doesn't need to define everything, sure, but that led to late-night reading as to why the standard is so damn old. Surely minor advances like the whole Internet thingy would warrant some updates to spec, even if the language is most likely most powerful in existence. When you start digging into these kinds of things, you are bound to discover something very ugly. And I did just that.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Basically, the whole standardization effort of Common Lisp was initialized by US Department of Defense, because it was funding whole lot of research that was going on and there were so many lispers around. Thanks to pre-internet era, researchers were using pretty much local Lisp dialects specific to their area, largely incompatible and unportable, which had been cooking in their labs with myriad of different hardware and operating systems for decades. Thus, DoD decreed that for funding to continue, all the interest groups need to gather and create uniform standard Lisp. Too bad there was already dialect called Standard Lisp, so what became was Common Lisp. The standardization process was long and overtly political, with everyone wanting to maintain some compatibility with their own dialect or have it work like their dialect. In the first round Americans even forgot that they are not the only lispers on planet, forgetting to invite Europeans and Japanese into the standardization process. This was remedied later, but the damage was done and yet another dialect was born, called EuLisp. Arguably the largest damage that got done during this process was not defining Common Lisp as Lisp-1 type, which led to Great Schism only comparable in size to separation of Catholic and Orthodox churches. Common Lisp decided to remain as Lisp-2, and this was mostly strong armed by the Lisp Machine corporations such as Symbolics, because their dialects were Lisp-2 so obviously their business would suffer. Keep in mind that they went out of business very shortly thereafter anyways.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"So, what are Lisp-1 and Lisp-2? It means differences in namespace. Lisp-1 has one namespace for all symbols, shared between functions and variables. That means that you can't have function named list and variable named list in the same scope. Lisp-2 has two namespaces for symbols, one for functions and one for variables. You can now have function list and variable list. Already in 1970's there emerged a dialect called Scheme which had only one namespace. Benefits of one namespace lie in cleaner code and even simpler interaction with the language, which in turn theoretically allows even more powerful expressions than Lisp-2. I myself can't say much on the matter except for the immediately obvious cleanliness part due to some exposure to Scheme but looking at other Lisps it might have some truth in it. Clojure, which is perhaps the highest profile and latest Lisp, is Lisp-1 type. So is EuLisp and obviously all the myriad of Scheme implementations which are borderline dialects (Racket, Chicken, Bigloo...). Obviously, lots of very smart people have deemed Lisp-1 as a superior solution. That leaves Common Lisp pair-dancing with Emacs Lisp as the only Lisp-2 types. Curiously, both have their roots in times before Scheme, which make them look a bit like ancient relics. If Common Lisp had been made as Lisp-1 during the standardization process, I have no doubts that Common Lisp usage would be higher. Now, I must stress that multiple namespaces are not in any way a bad thing. On contrary, C programmers struggle with single namespace. It is entirely possible that single namespace is a dead-end, a groovy 70's fad which Scheme adapted from C. In any case, there was a schism, and Common Lisp is less clean. Enter the next problem.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Common Lisp has implementations, roughly aimed at different things. Thanks to apparent end of standardization process once it was finished in 1994, they implement a lot of things differently. Most recommended implementation is SBCL due to high performance. Different implementations are not that bad of a thing, since all languages have them (think GCC vs CLANG, Oracle JDK vs Open JDK etc.). It's that standards committee is apparently either dead or in cryostasis, and the longer the spec is not updated, the farther implementations start to drift, making updating the standard very long process with lots of compromises (sound familiar?). Scheme and Clojure are a lot more active in that regard, with latest Scheme spec R7RS published 2013 and latest Clojure four days ago (version 1.8, 2016-01-19). That means that for someone wanting to learn Lisp, there is no single Lisp to learn from: which dialect, which implementation? To make things worse, there is that serious technical rift between Common Lisp and the rest due to great Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 schism, which seems to be won by the former judging by the apparent success of Clojure. Hell, even GNU endorses Guile, a Scheme, as the official scripting language. It's like trying to learn how to bicycle in a candy-store while trying to decide candy for the evening. That is, if you are aware of this, which you dear curious reader now are. If you simply plunge into learning some Lisp like I did, then you will be ok, although after learning of all this you may have some serious afterthoughts (I know I had).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"To further increase difficulty of deciding what to learn, Common Lisp is widely held as most practical choice for real-life programming. Greenspun's Tenth Rule states that \\\"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\\\" That means that to do same things Common Lisp has readily built-in or can express effortlessly, C developers must put in a lot of effort and end-result will still be substandard. This also applies to other languages, including Scheme. I've been asking around, and indeed Schemers tend to replicate things that are in Common Lisp in their programs, but this is simply because Common Lisp is much larger. Scheme R7RS specification is 88 pages, while Common Lisp CLtL2 is 1096 pages. Kind of like comparing C to C++, so it is not surprising. A paining what-if scenario is imagining if Common Lisp had become Lisp-1, that is, practically a very large Scheme for very serious and practical uses. Then the comparison between C and C++ would be direct, as Common Lisp and Scheme would be compatible in the most fundamental level. Then there would essentially be only the choice of large or small Lisp to hack with.

Then we instantiated book with title Old Hat and author as Billy and define it as parameter named book. But oh no! Author was wrong, so we set it to Bella. Now compare to following where we def foo as 42 and change it to 13...</p>\n\n  <code>\n    >> (defparameter foo 42)<br>\n    >> (setf foo 13)\n  </code>\n\n  <p>...and the following where we def bar as list (1 7 3) and change 7 to 2...</p>\n\n  <code>\n    (defparameter bar '(1 7 3))<br>\n    >> (setf (cadr bar) 2)\n  </code>\n\n  <p>Are you starting to see a pattern here? We are defining various things the same way from objects to simplest integers. And we are changing the return values in the same way. There is zero confusion. If you are wondering why the hell defparameter is so long, it's because it's rarely used, usually only for global values and symbol put into earmuffs like this *foo* to signal it as such. Normally lispers use let expression to maintain closure inside a function (just three letters, much better).</p>\n  <p>For sake of demonstration, this is how to do the bar example in typical Java (granted, data structures are different here, but you get the general point):</p>\n\n  <code>\n    private ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; bar = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br>\n    bar.add(1); <br>\n    bar.add(7); <br>\n    bar.add(3);<br>\n    bar.set(1, 2);\n  </code>\n\n  <p>Not so long now, eh? But yeah, it could be shorter.</p>\n  <p>Powers outside syntax again flow from the simplicity of the syntax and homoiconicity. Remember how I said that people of old days had amazing machines with ability to tweak entire Lisp operating system at runtime? You can relive the past right now! Start Lisp environment such as Emacs with SLIME. Write a program in Common Lisp that loops and start it from REPL, the Lisp command prompt. Then, redefine symbols and functions to your hearts content, reloading them with C-c C-c command while the program is running. Yes, program behavior changes on the fly. REPL itself is just acronym for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. Guess how you implement your own REPL? You do it literally with following:</p>\n\n  <code>\n    (loop (print (eval (read))))\n  </code>\n\n  <p>Which leads us to the next section: problems with Lisp. Once I started getting into Common Lisp, I started getting into Lisp in general. And here there be dragons. First thing when I ventured into networking side of things was that despite Common Lisp being quite large with 927 symbols, none deal with sockets. They are missing from the ANSI standard, which is now 21 years old and never revised since. Implementation of lot of things not specified in standard vary by implementation. Things in SBCL are totally different to CLISP when it comes to sockets, so I had to do some reading of SBCL manual in addition to book I was reading on Common Lisp which uses CLISP (Conrad Barski's excellent Land of Lisp). Well, standard doesn't need to define everything, sure, but that led to late-night reading as to why the standard is so damn old. Surely minor advances like the whole Internet thingy would warrant some updates to spec, even if the language is most likely most powerful in existence. When you start digging into these kinds of things, you are bound to discover something very ugly. And I did just that.</p>\n  <p>Basically, the whole standardization effort of Common Lisp was initialized by US Department of Defense, because it was funding whole lot of research that was going on and there were so many lispers around. Thanks to pre-internet era, researchers were using pretty much local Lisp dialects specific to their area, largely incompatible and unportable, which had been cooking in their labs with myriad of different hardware and operating systems for decades. Thus, DoD decreed that for funding to continue, all the interest groups need to gather and create uniform standard Lisp. Too bad there was already dialect called Standard Lisp, so what became was Common Lisp. The standardization process was long and overtly political, with everyone wanting to maintain some compatibility with their own dialect or have it work like their dialect. In the first round Americans even forgot that they are not the only lispers on planet, forgetting to invite Europeans and Japanese into the standardization process. This was remedied later, but the damage was done and yet another dialect was born, called EuLisp. Arguably the largest damage that got done during this process was not defining Common Lisp as Lisp-1 type, which led to Great Schism only comparable in size to separation of Catholic and Orthodox churches. Common Lisp decided to remain as Lisp-2, and this was mostly strong armed by the Lisp Machine corporations such as Symbolics, because their dialects were Lisp-2 so obviously their business would suffer. Keep in mind that they went out of business very shortly thereafter anyways.</p>\n  <p>So, what are Lisp-1 and Lisp-2? It means differences in namespace. Lisp-1 has one namespace for all symbols, shared between functions and variables. That means that you can't have function named list and variable named list in the same scope. Lisp-2 has two namespaces for symbols, one for functions and one for variables. You can now have function list and variable list. Already in 1970's there emerged a dialect called Scheme which had only one namespace. Benefits of one namespace lie in cleaner code and even simpler interaction with the language, which in turn theoretically allows even more powerful expressions than Lisp-2. I myself can't say much on the matter except for the immediately obvious cleanliness part due to some exposure to Scheme but looking at other Lisps it might have some truth in it. Clojure, which is perhaps the highest profile and latest Lisp, is Lisp-1 type. So is EuLisp and obviously all the myriad of Scheme implementations which are borderline dialects (Racket, Chicken, Bigloo...). Obviously, lots of very smart people have deemed Lisp-1 as a superior solution. That leaves Common Lisp pair-dancing with Emacs Lisp as the only Lisp-2 types. Curiously, both have their roots in times before Scheme, which make them look a bit like ancient relics. If Common Lisp had been made as Lisp-1 during the standardization process, I have no doubts that Common Lisp usage would be higher. Now, I must stress that multiple namespaces are not in any way a bad thing. On contrary, C programmers struggle with single namespace. It is entirely possible that single namespace is a dead-end, a groovy 70's fad which Scheme adapted from C. In any case, there was a schism, and Common Lisp is less clean. Enter the next problem.</p>\n  <p>Common Lisp has implementations, roughly aimed at different things. Thanks to apparent end of standardization process once it was finished in 1994, they implement a lot of things differently. Most recommended implementation is SBCL due to high performance. Different implementations are not that bad of a thing, since all languages have them (think GCC vs CLANG, Oracle JDK vs Open JDK etc.). It's that standards committee is apparently either dead or in cryostasis, and the longer the spec is not updated, the farther implementations start to drift, making updating the standard very long process with lots of compromises (sound familiar?). Scheme and Clojure are a lot more active in that regard, with latest Scheme spec R7RS published 2013 and latest Clojure four days ago (version 1.8, 2016-01-19). That means that for someone wanting to learn Lisp, there is no single Lisp to learn from: which dialect, which implementation? To make things worse, there is that serious technical rift between Common Lisp and the rest due to great Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2 schism, which seems to be won by the former judging by the apparent success of Clojure. Hell, even GNU endorses Guile, a Scheme, as the official scripting language. It's like trying to learn how to bicycle in a candy-store while trying to decide candy for the evening. That is, if you are aware of this, which you dear curious reader now are. If you simply plunge into learning some Lisp like I did, then you will be ok, although after learning of all this you may have some serious afterthoughts (I know I had).</p>\n  <p>To further increase difficulty of deciding what to learn, Common Lisp is widely held as most practical choice for real-life programming. Greenspun's Tenth Rule states that \"Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\" That means that to do same things Common Lisp has readily built-in or can express effortlessly, C developers must put in a lot of effort and end-result will still be substandard. This also applies to other languages, including Scheme. I've been asking around, and indeed Schemers tend to replicate things that are in Common Lisp in their programs, but this is simply because Common Lisp is much larger. Scheme R7RS specification is 88 pages, while Common Lisp CLtL2 is 1096 pages. Kind of like comparing C to C++, so it is not surprising. A paining what-if scenario is imagining if Common Lisp had become Lisp-1, that is, practically a very large Scheme for very serious and practical uses. Then the comparison between C and C++ would be direct, as Common Lisp and Scheme would be compatible in the most fundamental level. Then there would essentially be only the choice of large or small Lisp to hack with. Then again, we still don't have long enough hindsight to decide if Lisp-1 indeed is truly superior or historical error. There really is no consensus on that. But there is the rift.</p>\n  <p>On the bright side, understanding basic operating principle of either plus the main difference makes switching between Scheme and Common Lisp very trivial. A few examples:</p>\n\n  <code>\n  ;;common lisp<br>\n  (defun pow (x) <br>\n    (* x x))<br><br>\n\n  ;;scheme<br>\n  (define (pow x) <br>\n    (* x x))<br><br>\n\n  ;;common lisp<br>\n  (defvar x 5)<br><br>\n\n  ;;scheme<br>\n  (define x 5)\n  </code>\n\n  <p>The largest difference in syntax is in handling of functions that are not in beginning of list due to different approaches to namespace. In Common Lisp, you need to explicitly state with #' that what you are calling is a function in places where program excepts variable. These are the same, first two are Common Lisp, first line without syntactic sugar and then all sugar, same with last two Scheme examples:</p>\n\n  <code>\n    (map (quote list) (function +) (list 1 2) (list 3 5))<br>\n    (mapcar #'+ '(1 2) '(3 5))<br><br>\n\n    (map + (list 1 2) (list 3 5))<br>\n    (map + '(1 2) '(3 5))\n  </code>\n\n  <p>These differences give Scheme a certain pleasant airy feel to it compared to Common Lisp. It also makes building higher-order functions easier and makes the look of program more consistent. Then again, the airy feel comes with price: you can't give variables simple names like list is the classic example, and generally the space for functions and variables diminishes rapidly the larger the application gets. Other caveat is readability. While less pleasant looking thanks to that ugly #', you can spot functions immediately at a glance. There are always two sides to the coin.</p>\n  <p>It should be noted, that while Scheme was devised by two life-long academics as research and teaching language, Common Lisp evolved over decades of use by scientists, industry and military. Notably parallel with Scheme before and after standardization process. It is one seriously battle-hardened language. There may be more to the story of why it is Lisp-2 than just \"stubborn greedy companies\" which was my initial thought. Jury is still out on the matter, and it might be never resolved. Scheme has hygienic macros, Lisp has true macros. Scheme is restricted in namespace, Lisp is not (and can create new ones trivially). Scheme has symbol case sensitivity, Lisp doesn't. Even now, there are also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X69_42Mj-g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">very smart people</a> who make a conscious and well-informed decision to make new implementations of Common Lisp instead of Scheme for their needs. Finally, Common Lisp is simply great fun. It's dead simple, powerful and just reading about its history is exciting. In a sense, it is the eternal programming language.</p>\n  <p>In case you read this entire thing, I might as well give reading recommendations. As a result, from being battle-hardened programming language with deep roots and with exceptional capabilities even today, it has excellent literature available.</p>\n\n  <ul><b>Books</b>\n    <li>Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation (1990)</li>\n    <li>Let Over Lambda (2008)</li>\n    <li>Practical Common Lisp (2005)</li>\n    <li>On Lisp (1993)</li>\n    <li>ANSI Common Lisp (1996)</li>\n    <li>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp (1992)</li>\n    <li>Land of Lisp (2011)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <br/>\n  <ul><b>Articles</b>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beating the Averages</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070407230302/http://bc.tech.coop/blog/060118.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lisp is for Entrepreneurs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.loper-os.org/?p=69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Where Lisp Fails: at Turning People into Fungible Cogs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/12/03/why-ruby-is-an-acceptable-lisp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Ruby is an acceptable Lisp</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://locklessinc.com/articles/why_lisp_failed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why Lisp Failed</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/writings/Lisp_Curse.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Lisp Curse</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  <footer>2016-01-23</footer>\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Lisp1'\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=template&id=093565b0&\"\nimport script from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Lisp1.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"Thoughts on Lisp, part 2\")]),_c('img',{attrs:{\"src\":require(\"../../assets/you-have-lisp.jpg\"),\"alt\":\"[You have Lisp funny]\",\"title\":\"from 'Git The Princess!' comic by Mart Virkus, Toggl\"}}),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Initially my adventures in Lisp began because of conscious search for the ultimate programming language.

Learning from reflections, I will not embark on designing such language, as I now believe such language already exists among hundreds of different programming languages, and I believe if it is The One, it must manifest via organic growth where its benefits are so obvious compared to competing programming languages, that developers and corporations switch to it autonomously.</p>\n  <footer>2018-06-14</footer>\n</div>\n</template>\n\n<style scoped>\nimg {\n  width: 400px;\n}\n</style>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Lisp2'\n}\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=template&id=4fc05762&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./Lisp2.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=4fc05762&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"4fc05762\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"writing\"},[_c('h1',[_vm._v(\"Adventures with Kubuntu 15.04 PPA's\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Sometimes, there comes so many mishaps in a row that instead of pulling out your hair, you just can't help but laugh.

Update: In fact, both GNOME 3.16 and Plasma 5.3, which both shipped with F22, are so good that I have a hard time deciding which one to use as my daily desktop.</p>\n  <p>Currently writing this small update from GNOME. 3.16 has fixed three of my biggest grievances: very slow animation speeds (no more need for impatience), tendency to stutter with many windows when entering Activities if dynamic desktops are enabled (now I can use them yay) and notification/tray area in the bottom. Window titles of default Adwaita on traditional applications seems to be a bit slimmer as well, so I don't have urge to quickhack metacity anymore. Not that I care much for GNOME nowadays, but still this is a excellent release. I have never been this excited about a single Linux distro version release before, and I've been using these things for a decade. In the end F22 really did deliver. This is just fantastic release.</p>\n  <p>Discovered an excellent post-install tool called <a href=\"https://satya164.github.io/fedy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fedy</a>.

Main strengths of openSUSE are technical, shipping with extremely good package manager zypper and YaST for configuring pretty much anything under the hood with a nice GUI (think Windows Control Panel). It also has the greatest KDE implementation of major distributions IMHO (arguably Chakra has the best one). But it isn't perfect. The default repositories are quite small so I had six extras setup at one point which really slowed down every package action, sometimes their security policies were <a href=\"http://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/467942-networkmanager-requires-root-privileges-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">absolutely bonkers</a> and so forth. But generally it's stable and robust.</p>\n  <p><em>Did you know Sailfish and Tizen make use of techonologies pioneered by openSUSE? They both utilize zypper!</em></p>\n\n  <h2>Ubuntu</h2>\n  <img src=\"../../assets/ubuntu.png\">\n  <p>The distro that almost everyone starts with. However, I can not recommend this distribution or any of its many derivatives to anyone, especially not for new users. There are things that are done horribly wrong in this distribution on the most fundamental level. Or if you insist on using it yourself despite the numerous obvious problems you must have encountered during your time with it, at least do not recommend it to others. <router-link :to=\"{name:'ubuntuthebroken'}\">Please read my rant about its inherent issues and their likely causes.</router-link>\n  <p>Some people like also complain that Canonical is hostile to good of greater community, as they often do their own thing with little regard to \"bigger picture\" of entire Linux ecosystem. I don't think like that. If they want to go their own way in matters of desktop, init system or whatever, it's their call and they are free to do so. Hell, for a short while their Upstart really <em>was</em> the technically best init system for Linux systems! And it was adopted by others! Let's say against all odds Mir really ends up being technically superior to Wayland. Then the initial power struggle between the two display managers will ultimately be a good thing. Their <span title=\"Insisting on doing duplicate work instead of contributing to existing projects\">NIH Syndrome</span> is their own choice.</p>\n  <p><em>Did you know Ubuntu logo comes from three people holding hands?

And then there are at least 3 good IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans) that come to mind, all of them multiplatform.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        All of these considerations, and many more intertwined inbetween, made Java my choice for pivoting and specializing into. And should the worst happen for whatever black swan reason of Java becoming obsolete in my lifetime, its conventions inherited by those that came after it would surely make any transition to the new great a breeze. <i>\"Java developer never goes hungry.\"</i>\n      </p>\n    <h2>Appendix: Was C# ever an option?</h2>\n      <p>\n        C# is intentionally similar to Java with roughly the same use cases. I gave serious thought into specializing into it instead of Java, but ultimately decided not to do it for several reasons. First of all, I came to understand that the performance under ASP.NET is dogshit compared to Java's Spring or JakartaEE. Obviously, if big names migrate to Java instead of ASP.NET there has to be something in big boy stories of cloud unviability of C# past certain point. Not to mention Microsoft basically admitting it themselves with that little Java conference of theirs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Secondly, as an UI oriented man, there is something wrong about C# applications I get on Windows 10, either as a sides directly from Microsoft or from Microsoft Store. Relatively slow application loading times, and then there is no snappiness anywhere, and - now this is hard to explain in concrete measurable terms - but a <i>visceral feeling of tardiness and gummy</i> when using those. I am not sure if it's the animations or what, but I perceive a slight lag and delay on whatever I am doing with those applications. Despite things like Xamarin and how ubiquitous C# is on Windows, the thought of doing any UI work with C# seems just unprofessional.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Third is tooling. I came to understand there is nothing like Maven for C# so that's a big no. Second is IDEs, with Visual Studio Community being the only excellent free one that I know of. Problem being of course its ginormous size of about 10Gb just to get something done on Windows desktop. But I don't use only Windows so there is that too. Because of the almost total reliance on Visual Studio, C# quickly becomes a non-option.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        All in all, C# was an option, but then again not really. Not from entreprenurial point of view, not from developer point of view.\n      </p>\n    <footer>2021-01-30</footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'WhyJava'\n}\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./WhyJava.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
